#summary Theme Settings

= Introduction =

In order to be able to use your theme, you need to have a GXGlobal.cfg in SD:/config/ to point to the theme folder.

If your wii is using 16:9 settings, in GXGlobal.cfg, put the following line:
wtheme_path = SD:/mytheme/ (or the theme folder you use) 

Note: wtheme_path config option might be removed in the future release

If your wii is using 4:3 settings, in GXGlobal.cfg, put the following line:
theme_path = SD:/mytheme/ (or the theme folder you use)
