In order to be able to use your theme, you need to have a config.txt in your SD card root to point to the theme folder.

If your wii is using 16:9 settings, in config.txt, put the following line:
wtheme_path = SD:/mytheme/ (or the theme folder you use)

If your wii is using 4:3 settings, in config.txt, put the following line:
theme_path = SD:/mytheme/ (or the theme folder you use)

  * theme.txt is the place you put the settings of the theme
