This is the description for global config and all the settings in the Loader. 
All the settings that are being made in global settings are saved to <b>global_settings.cfg</b>. 
You can also edit the global_settings.cfg manuel which is not needed though. 

The global settings are the standard for all games. The individuel gamesettings are overriding the global settings.
