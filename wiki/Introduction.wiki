= Introduction =

Welcome to the Wiki for USB Loader GX. USB Loader GX is a USB loader for the Wii, and it's purpose is to allow playing your game backups from your USB drive. It is based off of Waninkoko's original USB loader, with a gui based off of libwiigui by Tantric. This loader has the look and feel of the original system menu for the Wii by Nintendo, and offers many powerful functions.
