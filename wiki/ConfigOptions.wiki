#summary Config Options

= Introduction =

Currently, there are only a few config options. I will try to add more after I am done with the theme. The config.txt should sit inside *SD:/config/* directory.

= Contents of config.txt =

  * *godmode = 0 1* (default is 0. 0 means turn off godmode by default, 1 otherwise)

  * *unlock_code = ab121b* (you can set whatever password you want as long as it is shorter than 19 characters)

  * *parentalcontrol = 0 1 2 3* (set game access level. Need to use with titles.txt. If the loader is in unlock mode, this would be turned off)

  * *theme_path = SD:/theme/* (set the theme folder path. Remember to put '/' at the end of the path. If you are using 16:9, use wtheme_path instead)

  * *wtheme_path = SD:/wtheme/* (set the theme folder path for 16:9. This option might be removed in the future)

  * *widescreen = 0 1* (when set to 1, the loader would force 16:9 mode. When set to 0, the loader would force 4:3 mode)
